        The Casa Manila or “Manila House” is a living museum that features the lifestyle of an affluent Filipino family during the late Spanish colonial period. The façade of Casa Manila was patterned 
        after a house that once stood at Jaboneros Street in the Chinese district of Binondo in the 1850’s. The interior decor of the house follows the taste of the turn of the late 19th century where furniture and furnishings 
        were sourced from Europe and China. Painted walls, crystal chandeliers, carved traceries, Chinese ceramics and gilded furniture shows the elegance and luxury of a 19th century Manila house.

        Casa Manila is a museum in Intramuros depicting colonial lifestyle during Spanish colonization of the Philippines.

The museum is the imposing stone-and-wood structure c. 1850, one of the grand houses in Barrio San Luis (one of the four original villages of Intramuros) is located across historic San Agustin church and bounded by Calle Real, General Luna, Cabildo and Urdaneta streets. The other two are the Los Hidalgos, c. 1650 and Cuyugan Mansion, c. 1890.

Casa Manila is a copy of an 1850s San Nicolas House that was once located in Calle Jaboneros. The architect of Casa Manila was J. Ramon L. Faustmann. It was constructed by Imelda Marcos during the 1980s and modeled on Spanish colonial architecture.
